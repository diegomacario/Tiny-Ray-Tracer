#ifndef AFFINE_H
#define AFFINE_H

/*
Description:

   The Affine class is used to represent affine transformations. These can be translation, rotation and scale transformations.

   The enum below is used to specify the type of a transformation when creating it.
   Knowing the type of each transformation involved in an operation allows one to reduce the number of operations significantly.

Possible improvements:

   - The Affine class currently encompasses 3 transformation types. This class is well suited to be implemented with an inheritance hierarchy.

   - Matrices are currently stored as 4x4 arrays of floats. Since the last row of an affine transformation is always [0 0 0 1], they could be stored as 3x4 arrays of floats.

   - Inverting mixed matrices is not supported yet. It is not necessary, but it could be useful in the future.
