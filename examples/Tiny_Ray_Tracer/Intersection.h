Description:

   The Intersection struct contains all the information that needs be stored when a ray intersects a shape. This includes:

   - The point in space at which the ray intersects the shape.
   - The surface normal at the intersection point.
   - The material of the shape that is intersected by the ray.
   - The ambient illumination of the shape that is intersected by the ray.
   - The distance from the origin of the ray to the intersection point.

   The first 4 terms are used to make lighting calculations.
   The last term is used to compare different intersections in order to determine which one is the nearest one.
