/*
Description:

   The Normal class is used to represent normals in 3 dimensions.
   It provides useful functions to perform operations with normals.

   Note that normals are automatically normalized during construction and after any operations are performed on them.

Possible improvements:

   - Multiplying a normal with a scalar returns a vector. This behaviour is unusual, but it was implemented
     this way because returning a normal would remove the increase in magnitude through the automatic normalization.
